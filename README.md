This is a very WIP gameplay conversion for Doom 3: BFG Edition that aims to convert it into an over-the-shoulder survival horror game inspired by Resident Evil and Dead Space.
It is based on Robert Beckeban's enhanced engine. By nature, since modding support for BFG Edition was once non-existent, the mod needs to be compiled as it's own .exe. There are no .dlls here.

The readme for RBDOOM-3-BFG is here - https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG 

FEATURES
- Over the shoulder third person perspective, enabled by default.
- Sudden hacky switches between perspectives when interacting with terminals.

IDEAS
- General rebalancing of enemies and weapons to more survival horrory.
- New animations for player that work better with the perspective.

REALLY AMBITIOUS IDEAS
- New GUIs.
- Limited inventory system with management screen.

KNOWN ISSUES
- In a new game, the camera starts off at shoulder level with Doomguy until you zoom in the camera once, then the camera will lower and raise as normal.
- The camera transitions when interacting when terminals are very sudden and jarring.

SUGGESTIONS
- I recommend playing with a gamepad, but rebinding the flashlight button to B and binding the Left Trigger to "_zoom", a feature from Classic Doom 3 that was dummied out, but restored here and given a bit more functionality.
